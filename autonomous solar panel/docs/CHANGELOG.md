11/10/2020 - Creation of the first version of the project.

11/20/2020 - Change in the method of connecting elements. Instead of external pin connections, most of the elements were placed inside the PCB (printed circuit board).

12/12/2020 - Change in the method of voltage measurement. Using INA219 measurement modules and a multiplexer instead of the ADC channels of the microcontroller.

12/27/2020 - Improvement of the schematic and PCB (printed circuit board). The addition of an additional transistor to create a properly functioning charging control mechanism and the addition of pins for a programmer.
